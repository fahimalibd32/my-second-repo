    <div class="about">

        <p id="summery">Bangladesh have also played <b>152 T20Is</b>, winning 56. They played their 100th T20I against Zimbabwe in July 2021 which they won. Results have improved with wins against Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and West Indies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushfiqur_Rahim" target="_blank">Visit Mushfiqur Rahim's Wikipedia</a></p>

        <p id="carrer"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushfiqur_Rahim" target="_blank">Mushfiqur Rahim</a> captained in the Under-19 World Cup in February 2006, and featured in a Test in Bogra (that venue's first) against Sri Lanka the following month, though he could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. <strong>His first Test fifty came on the return tour of Sri Lanka the following year.</strong> Earlier in 2007, he was picked as the first-choice wicketkeeper, ahead of Khaled Mashud, for the World Cup in the West Indies - where he starred in Bangladesh's landmark defeat of India, anchoring the chase of 192 with 56 not out.</p>

        <p id="record">Mushfiqur came into his own as a Test batter in the 2010s, stepping up to No. 4, shedding the image of lower-order scrapper, taking on the mantle of dependable mainstay, and proving himself one the better players of spin in the Bangladesh line-up. His first hundred, the fastest by a Bangladesh batter then, came against India in Chattogram in 2010, and was followed two Tests later by 72 and 95 against England at the same venue.</p>
